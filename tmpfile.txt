When each key is encountered for the first time, it is not already in the mapping;
so an entry is automatically created using the default_factory function which returns an empty list.
The list.append() operation then attaches the value to the new list.
When keys are encountered again, the look-up proceeds normally (returning the list for that key) and the list.append() operation adds another value to the list.
This technique is simpler and faster than an equivalent technique using dict.setdefault():
